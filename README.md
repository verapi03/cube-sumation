# cube-sumation
You are given a 3-D Matrix in which each block contains 0 initially. The first block is defined by the coordinate (1,1,1) and the last block is defined by the coordinate (N,N,N). There are two types of queries.  UPDATE x y z W updates the value of block (x,y,z) to W.  QUERY x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 calculates the sum of the value of blocks whose x coordinate is between x1 and x2 (inclusive), y coordinate between y1 and y2 (inclusive) and z coordinate between z1 and z2 (inclusive).
